## Implementation of Logistic Regression Algorithm in Python from scratch (without using any machine leaning library) on Heart Disease Dataset.

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false.

Logical regression analyzes the relationship between one or more independent variables and classifies data into discrete classes. It is extensively used in predictive modeling, where the model estimates the mathematical probability of whether an instance belongs to a specific category or not.

For example, 0 – represents a negative class; 1 – represents a positive class. Logistic regression is commonly used in binary classification problems where the outcome variable reveals either of the two categories (0 and 1).
